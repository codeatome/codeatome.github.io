    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Shwasa, a rising sophomore passionate about science, technology, leadership, and public impact. Growing up in Silicon Valley, I was surrounded by innovation—and I’ve always been curious about how things work. That curiosity soon developed into a strong interest in biology and computer science, especially in the ways they intersect to improve healthcare outcomes.
    <br><br>
    Whether it’s working on genomics research projects, mentoring younger students, or designing outreach programs for community nonprofits, I thrive in environments where I can combine analytical thinking with real-world problem-solving. I'm especially drawn to computational biology and health technology because of their potential to revolutionize the way we understand and treat disease.
    <br><br>
    Outside of academics, I enjoy debating, running, and learning new languages. I love diving into topics that blend logic and creativity, and I’m always looking for ways to grow—whether through collaboration, challenge, or change.
    <br><br>
    Thanks for visiting my website! Keep scrolling to explore some of my favorite experiences, projects, and reflections.
