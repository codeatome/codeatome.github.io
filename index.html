    <h2>Experience</h2>

    <h3>Computational Biology Camp Member — MiRcore (July 2025)</h3>
    <p>I participated in a weeklong intensive program focused on computational biology, working closely with specialists and PhD mentors to explore fields such as genomics, systems biology, and personalized medicine. For my final project in the program, I collaborated with a team of high school researchers to analyze lung cancer genomic data, using computational tools to identify mutations, biomarkers, and patterns. We presented our findings at a group research conference, which gave me hands-on experience in applying bioinformatics to address real-world medical challenges.</p>

The program allowed me to strengthen abilities like planning, decision-making, and effective communication while learning how to lead teams and navigate complex challenges. This experience helped me refine my leadership style and apply it to problem-solving in academic and community settings.</p>
